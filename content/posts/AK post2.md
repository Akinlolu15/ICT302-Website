I can  identify and define key concepts in (web) content management way better than last week.
I can describe and compare content management systems that we have used.
I cannot manage content using established workflows yet because it is still very confusing.
I can somewhat identify and employ technologies related to content management but i still need guidance.
I can and i did  find and use resources for self-directed learning.
