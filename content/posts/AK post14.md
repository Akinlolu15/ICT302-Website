### Learning Report Module 14
I can identify and define key concepts in web content management for example this week with the plugin link  that i could use for advertismnets on wordpress and some channles o would use if i was a content manager
I can describe and compare content management mainly between hugo and wordpress as those have been main ones we have used and different types of plugins to add certain functions that wordpress didnt have available
I can manage content using established workflows as i did this week with the group blog post as i was an editor this week
I can identify and employ technologies related to content management like teams which we used for workflow and communication and canvas which i use everyday 
I can find and use resources for self-directed learning like exploring cms plugins for social media and channels i would use as a content manger
