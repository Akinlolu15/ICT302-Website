### Learning Report Module 13
I can identify and define key concepts in web content management for example this week with the plugins that i could use for advertismnets on wordpress
I can describe and compare content management mainly between hugo and wordpress as those have been main ones we have used and different types of plugins to add certain functions that wordpress didnt have available
I can manage content using established workflows as i did this week with the group blog post as i took care of the introduction and conclusion for this week
I can identify and employ technologies related to content management like teams which we used for workflow and communication and canvas which i use everyday
I can find and use resources for self-directed learning like exploring cms plugins for advertismnet which i chose as my model for making money
