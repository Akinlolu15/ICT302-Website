### Learning Report Module 15
I can identify and define key concepts in web content management for example with multidistribution channels i decribed my favourite content creator uses.  
I can describe and compare content management systems but this week i focused on content channels like yotube, twitter, reddit etc
I can manage content using established workflows as i did this week with the group blog post as i was an developer this week
I can identify and employ technologies related to content management like teams which we used for workflow and communication and canvas which i use everyday and linkeden which i have been usig more lately for my pursuit for an internship
I can find and use resources for self-directed learning like exploring cms plugins for social media and content channels i would use as a content manger
