### Learning Report Module 7
I can identify and define key concepts in web content management for example wordpress which is an open source CMS, meaning all of the code behind the software is available for anyone to examine, copy, and modify and this is one of the many features i adore about wordpress.
I can describe and compare content management  for example comparison between hugo and wordpress 
I can manage content using established workflows as i did this week with our blog post
I can identify and employ technologies related to content management like EasyWPguide and contentstack
I can find and use resources for self-directed learning like using markdownguide.org to help me as well commonmark.com
