### Learning Report Module 10
I can identify and define key concepts in web content management for example describing contnt types and sttiributes i will use to create a mailling address. 
I can describe and compare content management mainly between hugo and wordpress as those have been main ones we have used. 
I can manage content using established workflows as i did this week with peer feedback. 
I can identify and employ technologies related to content management like teams which we used for workflow and communication
I can find and use resources for self-directed learning like using markdownguide.org and w3schools.com for html help and this week even with the canvas help
