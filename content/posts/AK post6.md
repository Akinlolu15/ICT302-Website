### Learning Report Module 6
I can identify and define key concepts in web content management for example wordpress which is an open source CMS, meaning all of the code behind the software is available for anyone to examine, copy, and modify.
I am working towards describing and comparing content management  for example comparison between hugo and wordpress 
I can manage content using established workflows as i did as administrator this week with our blog post
I can identify and employ technologies related to content management like EasyWPguide
I can find and use resources for self-directed learning like using markdownguide.org to help me as well commonmark.com

heyyyy
