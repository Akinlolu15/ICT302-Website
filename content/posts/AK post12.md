### Learning Report Module 12
I can identify and define key concepts in web content management for example this week with the CMS plugins
I can describe and compare content management mainly between hugo and wordpress as those have been main ones we have used and different types of plugins to enhance functionality
I can manage content using established workflows as i did this week with the group blog post
I can identify and employ technologies related to content management like teams which we used for workflow and communication and canvas which i use everyday
I can find and use resources for self-directed learning like exploring cms plugins
